## Strategy

*   **Frontline Protector:** Captain America is a strong frontline tank. Use Shield Block to absorb enemy fire and protect your team, especially against high-damage ultimates or chokepoints.
*   **Initiator:** Heroic Leap is excellent for initiating engagements, stunning key targets, or closing gaps to protect vulnerable allies.
*   **Team Support:** Rallying Cry is a game-changing ultimate. Coordinate with your team to use it during critical pushes or defensive stands to turn the tide of battle.
