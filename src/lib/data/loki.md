*   **Critical Hit:** Yes
*   **Projectile Speed:** 70m/s

## Strategy

*   **Misdirection and Control:** Use Decoy Illusion to draw enemy attention, bait abilities, or scout dangerous areas. The disorientation effect can be crucial for team pushes.
*   **High Mobility:** Teleportation Trick is your primary escape and repositioning tool. Use it to get to high ground, escape focus fire, or quickly flank enemies.
*   **Ultimate Disruption:** Grand Deception is excellent for disrupting enemy formations, especially during objective contests or when facing grouped enemies. The confusion effect can turn a team fight in your favor.
*   **Patience is Key:** Loki thrives on chaos and confusion. Don't rush in. Instead, set up your illusions and teleportation to create openings for your team or pick off isolated targets.
