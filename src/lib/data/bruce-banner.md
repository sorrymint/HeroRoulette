## Strategy

* Hulk is a high-risk, high-reward tank who can quickly shift between harassing the enemy's backline and protecting his own on a whim. His high mobility allows him to quickly engage and disengage the enemy, giving him free reign to take or abandon almost any fight with enough foresight.
* Because Hulk lacks the tools to be a frontline wall for his team in the same way that Magneto or Doctor Strange can, it is not recommended to run him as a solo tank.
* One of the most important skills to learn as Hulk is learning which fights to take. Your large frame makes you highly susceptible to focus fire if you rush in haphazardly, so you should learn to engage the enemy when they're distracted by the rest of your team so they're forced to divert their attention between you and them. On the flipside, when you feel that a fight is going awry, you should not hesitate to jump out lest you be caught by the enemy.
* As Banner, you have the lowest health in the game at only 200, and both your weapon and sole ability in Gamma Grenade are highly ineffective. You should only be transforming back into this form while in the midst of jumping back to your team, as if you're transforming into Banner in the midst of the enemy, you are almost certainly dead. While in this form, focus on playing as safe as possible, landing as many shots with your gamma gun as you can to build up your gamma energy and transform back into Hulk ASAP.
  * Throwing the Gamma Grenade at your feet as Banner will automatically give you 8% of your gamma energy, so try to do so as often as possible to hasten your charge time.
  * Note that during all of your transformations, whether it be from Banner to Hero Hulk, Hero Hulk to Monster Hulk, or any Hulk back to Banner, you will be completely invincible, meaning you cannot receive any damage or be affected by crowd control.
* As Hero Hulk, you have two main methods of attack. His primary fire, Heavy Blow, is a series of fast, reliable melee swings with a wide AoE. While each individual hit may not be powerful, it will quickly build up high damage numbers the longer you remain next to the enemy, which, thanks to Hulk's incredible mobility, you can easily do. If the enemy is further away, your secondary fire, Gamma Burst, has you clap your hands to launch a fast projectile that deals solid damage. The projectile has infinite range, allowing Hulk a burst damage option even at far distances.
  * Your Gamma Burst is your highest-damaging attack outside of your ultimate, making it great as an engage when jumping to an enemy or as a finisher on someone who is injured.
* Indestructible Guard is your primary means of mitigation. Hulk will create a gamma bubble shield on himself and all allies within five meters of him. Any damage dealt to the shield will charge his ultimate.
  * This ability has multiple strong use cases. The first is as a way to engage on top of an enemy safely, protecting you from their initial burst so you can start punching away without worry. The second is as a way to secure your escape, allowing you to mitigate damage and crowd control thrown your way while you try to jump out. The third is as a quick peel option for your teammates, protecting them from big damage ultimates like Iron Man's Invincible Pulse Cannon or a flanker harassing the backline.
  * Radioactive Lockdown has the potential for huge denials for the enemy team. Hulk fires a projectile that deals minimal damage but will exile the target for two seconds. While exiled, the target is essentially treated as if they do not exist: they cannot move or receive damage or healing from any outside sources except for Hulk himself. Hitting an exiled enemy as Hulk will prematurely remove the status effect.
  * Like his Indestructible Guard, this ability has multiple use cases. First off, it serves as a way to quickly prevent a target from escaping: giving you time to leap toward them and start pummeling them before they can start running. The next is as a way to temporarily disable a target in the midst of a fight, buying you and your team some time to recover before they come back. Finally, you can use it to interrupt or even outright nullify big ultimates or abilities such as Scarlet Witch's Reality Erasure or Spider-Man's Spectacular Spin. 
  * Due to the ability's long cooldown, take care to not use the ability haphazardly, as it has the potential for huge denials when timed right.
* Incredible Leap is Hulk's primary means of movement. Hulk can charge a leap for up to two seconds before jumping forward a large distance. While leaping, he can cling to a wall by holding his jump button while colliding with one, and if he collides with an airborne enemy mid-leap, he will drag them down to earth, leaving them stunned. 
  * This is undoubtedly your most important ability as Hulk. It is key to everything you want to do, from engaging to disengaging to even dealing with pesky fliers. There is no cooldown on this ability nor is there a limit to how long you can have a leap charged, so always try to charge this ability even in the midst of fighting so you can have a leap ready to go at a moment's notice to either disengage or continue chasing an enemy. 
  * Try to get used to the timing it takes to charge up a minimum-power leap (roughly 0.7 seconds) so you can string multiple low-power leaps back to back. This can allow you to maneuver around the map faster than simply walking around or waiting for a fully-charged leap can.
* Hulk's ultimate, Hulk Smash!, transforms Hero Hulk into the towering Monster Hulk. In this form, you gain a massive health boost and stronger versions of your Gamma Burst and Radioactive Lockdown on significantly shorter cooldowns, however you also lose access to your Indestructible Guard. This form can last up to 12 seconds or until Monster Hulk sustains enough damage. If he transforms back with health still remaining, he will transform into Hero Hulk with health proportional to the amount he has left, but if he loses all of it, he will transform back into Banner.
  * As Monster Hulk, all of your attacks deal increased damage with shorter cooldowns, and your Heavy Blow deals knockback as well. This allows you to cause immense chaos in the midst of an enemy, and stringing in your melee attack between Gamma Bursts and leaps can lead to deadly combos. 
  * Monster Hulk's ultimate is World Breaker, which has him grab a nearby enemy to deal high damage and put them in a hard stun state. It is not recommended to use this ability right after transforming as it wastes precious seconds of the transformation: instead, use it as a finisher for the form to squeeze as much value out of the high health pool and innate damage reduction the ultimate offers as possible. 
  * While transforming into Monster Hulk, you will immediately be healed to the full Monster Hulk health level regardless of how injured you were before activation. As such, when you have your ultimate, don't hesitate to play aggressively so you can lull the enemy into a false sense of security when they think they have you cornered, only for you to transform and turn the tide back against them. Just make sure you don't activate it too late before you sustain too much damage and are forced to transform back into Banner.
* Hulk is currently one of the few characters in the game with multiple team-ups. His first is Gamma Monstro, in which he offers Namor a gamma-powered Monstro Spawn. The second is Fastball Special, in which he or The Thing can throw an allied Wolverine into the enemy to cause chaos. 
  * In the case of Fastball Special, it may be worth it to leap in with your Wolverine before throwing them, as you can then place an Indestructible Guard on yourself and your fellow Wolverine to protect the both of you as you cause chaos to the enemy.
